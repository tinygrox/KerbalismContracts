  description = VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) is a whiskbroom scanning radiometer that collects imagery and radiometric measurements of the land, atmosphere, cryosphere, and oceans in the visible and infrared bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. VIIRS's main uses include monitoring and investigating changes and properties in surface vegetation, land cover/use, the hydrologic cycle, and the planets energy budget over both regional and global scales. The data sets will allow for the assessment of how climate changes affect the planetary surface.
