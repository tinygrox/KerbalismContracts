  title = SkyLink Phase 1
  description = KerboNet has been a success and demonstrated that satellite based internet services are viable. However, due to the high latency of data connections caused by the high altitude of the satellites, KerboNet is not suitable for a lot of applications that require low latency. This is where SkyLink comes in. The goal is to build a satellite network that can provide high speed and low latency internet service.
  synopsis = Make sure that at least one High Speed Phased-Array (HSPA) antenna is above the given ground location at all times.
  completedMessage = Good job! If you can extend SkyLink to provide more coverage, it is going to be a huge success!
