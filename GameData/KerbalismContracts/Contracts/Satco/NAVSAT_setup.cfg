  description = Wernher and Bill were able to determine the orbit of Sputnik just by analyzing the beep signals that it sent out: using the doppler shift effect and recordings of the signal from known ground locations, they were able to calculate the exact trajectory. After a long evening at the bar, they came up with a cunning theory: could they do this the other way around? They think that it should be possible to determine your position on the ground just by listening to a satellite passing by on a known orbit. Lets find out if that works!
  synopsis = Launch a satellite with a TRANSIT transmitter on a trajectory that will pass over Wernhers Sentry. The Satellite must be visible from the location at a minimum elevation above the horizon, and it has to pass in such a way that the radial velocity (the velocity of the satellite in relation to the location on the ground) changes fast enough so that Wernher can use the doppler shift effect to validate his theory.
  completedMessage = It worked! With enough of those satellites we can turn this into a global positioning system!
