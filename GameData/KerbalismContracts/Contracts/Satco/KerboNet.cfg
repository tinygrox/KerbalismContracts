  description = Provide internet service that is available on no less than 75% of the planetary surface with fixed antennas.
  synopsis = Use as many High Speed Phased-Array (HSPA) antennas as you need to provide internet service on no less than 75% of the surface of @/targetBody. The ground stations use fixed antennas, so make sure that the HSPA antennas do not change their relative positions in the sky.
  completedMessage = Good job! Your intenet service has the dubious reputation of being slow and expensive, but it works reliably across the globe.
