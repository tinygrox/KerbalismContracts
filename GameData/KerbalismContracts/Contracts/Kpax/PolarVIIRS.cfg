  title = Observe the Ice Caps
  description = In our effort to learn more about weather and climate of our planet, we need to perform long term observations of various surface features all over the planet. This time, we need your help to keep track of how our polar ice caps react to climate.
  synopsis = You are tasked with building a global VIIRS satellite network for varioius surface observations. Have a VIIRS satellite in low orbit pass over the designated regions near the poles at least once per day, for a total time span of no less than two years.
  completedMessage = VIIRS continues to provide valuable information about the environment and climate on our planet.
