  title = Build a surface observation network
  description = VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) is a whiskbroom scanning radiometer that collects imagery and radiometric measurements of the land, atmosphere, cryosphere, and oceans in the visible and infrared bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. VIIRS's main uses include monitoring and investigating changes and properties in surface vegetation, land cover/use, the hydrologic cycle, and the planets energy budget over both regional and global scales. You will need a number of satellites in low orbit to provide VIIRS data from all locations on the globe, sometimes on very short notice.
  synopsis = You are tasked with building a global VIIRS satellite network for varioius surface observations. Build a cluster of satellites to observe the marked locations from low orbit.
  completedMessage = Good. Keep those satellites, you're going to need them!
