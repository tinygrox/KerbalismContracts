  title = VIIRS: Observe a Wildfire
  description =  The first moments after a fire ignites are critical. When intense winds combine with dry fuel conditions, the response time can mean the difference between a catastrophic fire, and one that is quickly contained. Orbital imagers like VIIRS can observe a wildfire at any given location a few times a day. They can map fires and burn scars with high accuracy, providing crucial data for the fire fighters on the surface. The optical and thermal bands, which detect reflected and radiated energy, provide daytime visible imagery and night-time information on active fires. VIIRS also provides nighttime fire detection capabilities through its Day-Night Band, which can measure low-intensity visible light emitted by small and fledgling fires.
  synopsis = You are tasked with building a global VIIRS satellite network for varioius surface observations, including the detection and mapping of wild fires in remote areas. Within the hour of accepting this contract, track the development of a wildfire from low orbit by providing up-to-date VIIRS data of the area at least once every 4 hours, for a total time span of two weeks.
  completedMessage = Thanks to your support the wildfire could be contained. Keep those satellites, we'll need them again!
