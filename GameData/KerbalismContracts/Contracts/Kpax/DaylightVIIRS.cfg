  title = Observe the surface in daylight
  description = Many applications of orbital surface observations have to be made in daylight, but need to avoid suboptimal illumination conditions on the surface. Most notably in this context is the avoidance of sun glints on water bodies: the sunlight reflecting from the surface would blind and possibly damage the sensors. Other applications, like long-term topology mapping, require the illumination to be constant so that the images remain comparable.
  synopsis = You are tasked with building a global VIIRS satellite network for varioius surface observations. Provide low orbit VIIRS surface observation data for an accumulated duration of 3 years. For our application, we need a solar elevation on the surface of no less than 45 degrees while avoiding sun glints that (solar elevations > 86Â°).
  completedMessage = Perfect. The data you provided will have a big impact on policies regarding agriculture and topology development.
